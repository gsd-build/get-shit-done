# Changelog

All notable changes to GSD will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `gsd-verifier` agent now declares the Write tool, avoiding Bash heredoc fallbacks that could corrupt editor permission files when generating VERIFICATION.md reports.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- `--auto` flag for `/gsd:new-project` — runs research → requirements → roadmap automatically after config questions. Expects idea document via @ reference (e.g., `/gsd:new-project --auto @prd.md`)

### Fixed
- Windows: SessionStart hook now spawns detached process correctly
- Windows: Replaced HEREDOC with literal newlines for git commit compatibility
- Research decision from `/gsd:new-milestone` now persists to config.json

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **gsd-tools verification suite**: `verify plan-structure`, `verify phase-completeness`, `verify references`, `verify commits`, `verify artifacts`, `verify key-links` — deterministic structural checks
- **gsd-tools frontmatter CRUD**: `frontmatter get/set/merge/validate` — safe YAML frontmatter operations with schema validation
- **gsd-tools template fill**: `template fill summary/plan/verification` — pre-filled document skeletons
- **gsd-tools state progression**: `state advance-plan`, `state update-progress`, `state record-metric`, `state add-decision`, `state add-blocker`, `state resolve-blocker`, `state record-session` — automates STATE.md updates
- **Local patch preservation**: Installer now detects locally modified GSD files, backs them up to `gsd-local-patches/`, and creates a manifest for restoration
- `/gsd:reapply-patches` command to merge local modifications back after GSD updates

### Changed
- Agents (executor, planner, plan-checker, verifier) now use gsd-tools for state updates and verification instead of manual markdown parsing
- `/gsd:update` workflow now notifies about backed-up local patches and suggests `/gsd:reapply-patches`

### Fixed
- Added workaround for Claude Code `classifyHandoffIfNeeded` bug that causes false agent failures — execute-phase and quick workflows now spot-check actual output before reporting failure

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- 10 new gsd-tools CLI commands that replace manual AI orchestration of mechanical operations:
  - `phase add <desc>` — append phase to roadmap + create directory
  - `phase insert <after> <desc>` — insert decimal phase
  - `phase remove <N> [--force]` — remove phase with full renumbering
  - `phase complete <N>` — mark done, update state + roadmap, detect milestone end
  - `roadmap analyze` — unified roadmap parser with disk status
  - `milestone complete <ver> [--name]` — archive roadmap/requirements/audit
  - `validate consistency` — check phase numbering and disk/roadmap sync
  - `progress [json|table|bar]` — render progress in various formats
  - `todo complete <file>` — move todo from pending to completed
  - `scaffold [context|uat|verification|phase-dir]` — template generation

### Changed
- Workflows now delegate deterministic operations to gsd-tools CLI, reducing token usage and errors:
  - `remove-phase.md`: 13 manual steps → 1 CLI call + confirm + commit
  - `add-phase.md`: 6 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `insert-phase.md`: 7 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `complete-milestone.md`: archival delegated to `milestone complete`
  - `progress.md`: roadmap parsing delegated to `roadmap analyze`

### Fixed
- Execute-phase now correctly spawns `gsd-executor` subagents instead of generic task agents
- `commit_docs=false` setting now respected in all `.planning/` commit paths (execute-plan, debugger, reference docs all route through gsd-tools CLI)
- Execute-phase orchestrator no longer bloats context by embedding file content — passes paths instead, letting subagents read in their fresh context
- Windows: Normalized backslash paths in gsd-tools invocations (contributed by @rmindel)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Optimized workflow context loading to eliminate redundant file reads, reducing token usage by ~5,000-10,000 tokens per workflow execution

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- Context-optimizing parsing commands in gsd-tools (`phase-plan-index`, `state-snapshot`, `summary-extract`) — reduces agent context usage by returning structured JSON instead of raw file content

### Fixed
- Installer no longer deletes opencode.json on JSONC parse errors — now handles comments, trailing commas, and BOM correctly (#474)

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- `gsd-tools history-digest` — Compiles phase summaries into structured JSON for faster context loading
- `gsd-tools phases list` — Lists phase directories with filtering (replaces fragile `ls | sort -V` patterns)
- `gsd-tools roadmap get-phase` — Extracts phase sections from ROADMAP.md
- `gsd-tools phase next-decimal` — Calculates next decimal phase number for insert operations
- `gsd-tools state get/patch` — Atomic STATE.md field operations
- `gsd-tools template select` — Chooses summary template based on plan complexity
- Summary template variants: minimal (~30 lines), standard (~60 lines), complex (~100 lines)
- Test infrastructure with 22 tests covering new commands

### Changed
- Planner uses two-step context assembly: digest for selection, full SUMMARY for understanding
- Agents migrated from bash patterns to structured gsd-tools commands
- Nested YAML frontmatter parsing now handles `dependency-graph.provides`, `tech-stack.added` correctly

## [1.12.1] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Consolidated workflow initialization into compound `init` commands, reducing token usage and improving startup performance
- Updated 24 workflow and agent files to use single-call context gathering instead of multiple atomic calls

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-07

### Changed
- **Architecture: Thin orchestrator pattern** — Commands now delegate to workflows, reducing command file size by ~75% and improving maintainability

- **Token reduction** — ~22k characters removed from affected command/workflow/agent files
- **Condensed agent prompts** — Same behavior with fewer words (executor, planner, verifier, researcher agents)

### Added
- `gsd-tools.js` CLI utility with functions: state load/update, resolve-model, find-phase, commit, verify-summary, generate-slug, current-timestamp, list-todos, verify-path-exists, config-ensure-section

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- Uncommitted planning mode: Keep `.planning/` local-only (not committed to git) via `planning.commit_docs: false` in config.json. Useful for OSS contributions, client work, or privacy preferences.

## [1.6.2] - 2025-01-17

### Changed
- README restructured with clearer 6-step workflow: init → discuss → plan → execute → verify → complete
- Discuss-phase and verify-work now emphasized as critical steps in core workflow documentation

- Explicit scope guardrail prevents scope creep during discussion — captures deferred ideas without acting on them
- CONTEXT.md template restructured for decisions (domain boundary, decisions by category, Claude's discretion, deferred ideas)
- Downstream awareness: discuss-phase ahora explicitly documents that CONTEXT.md feeds researcher and planner agents
- `/gsd:plan-phase` ahora integrates research — spawns `gsd-phase-researcher` before planning unless research exists or `--skip-research` flag used

- Phase verification: Automatic verification runs when a phase completes to catch stubs and incomplete implementations
- Goal-backward planning reference: Documentation for deriving must-haves from goals

### Changed
- execute-plan and execute-phase ahora spawn `gsd-executor` subagent instead of using inline workflow
- Roadmap and planning workflows enhanced with goal-backward analysis

### Removed
- Obsolete templates (`checkpoint-resume.md`, `subagent-task-prompt.md`) — logic ahora lives in subagents

### Fixed
- Updated remaining `general-purpose` subagent references to use `gsd-executor`

## [1.5.6] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- README: Separated flow into distinct steps (1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) making `research-project` clearly optional and `define-requirements` required
- README: Research recommended for quality; skip only for speed

### Fixed
- execute-phase: Phase metadata (timing, wave info) ahora bundled into single commit instead of separate commits

## [1.5.3] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- **execute-phase narration**: Orchestrator ahora describes what each wave builds before spawning agents, and summarizes what was built after completion. No more staring at opaque status updates.
- **new-project flow**: Ahora offers two paths — research first (recommended) or define requirements directly (fast path for familiar domains)
- **define-requirements**: Works without prior research. Gathers requirements through conversation when FEATURES.md doesn't exist.

### Removed
- Dead `/gsd:status` command (referenced abandoned background agent model)
- Unused `agent-history.md` template
- `_archive/` directory with old execute-phase version

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-15

- plan-phase loads REQUIREMENTS.md and shows phase-specific requirements before planning
- Requirements automatically marked Complete cuando phase finishes

### Changed
- Workflow preferences (mode, depth, parallelization) ahora asked in single prompt instead of 3 separate questions
- define-requirements shows full requirements list inline before commit (not just counts)
- Research-project and workflow aligned to both point to define-requirements as next step

### Fixed
- Requirements status ahora updated by orchestrator (commands) instead of subagent workflow, which couldn't determine phase completion

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- Research agents write their own files directly (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md) instead of returning results to orchestrator
- Slimmed principles.md and load it dynamically in core commands

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- New `/gsd:research-project` command for pre-roadmap ecosystem research — spawns parallel agents to investigate stack, features, architecture, and pitfalls before you commit to a roadmap
- New `/gsd:define-requirements` command for scoping v1 requirements from research findings — transforms "what exists in this domain" into "what we're building"
- Requirements traceability: phases ahora map to specific requirement IDs with 100% coverage validation

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** New project flow is ahora: `new-project → research-project → define-requirements → create-roadmap`
- Roadmap creation ahora requires REQUIREMENTS.md and validates all v1 requirements are mapped to phases
- Simplified questioning in new-project to four essentials (vision, core priority, boundaries, constraints)
