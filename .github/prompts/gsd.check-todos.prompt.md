## Preflight (required)

If the local GSD install does not exist in this workspace, do this **once**:

1. Check for: `./.claude/get-shit-done/`
2. If missing, run:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local
```

3. Then re-run the slash command: `/gsd.check-todos`

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
List all pending todos, allow selection, load full context for the selected todo, and route to appropriate action.

Routes to the check-todos workflow which handles:
- Todo counting and listing with area filtering
- Interactive selection with full context loading
- Roadmap correlation checking
- Action routing (work now, add to phase, brainstorm, create phase)
- STATE.md updates and git commits
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: .planning/STATE.md
- Read file at: .planning/ROADMAP.md
- Read file at: ../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/check-todos.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the check-todos workflow** from `@../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/check-todos.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Todo existence checking
2. Area filtering
3. Interactive listing and selection
4. Full context loading with file summaries
5. Roadmap correlation checking
6. Action offering and execution
7. STATE.md updates
8. Git commits
</process>
