## Preflight (required)

If the local GSD install does not exist in this workspace, do this **once**:

1. Check for: `./.claude/get-shit-done/`
2. If missing, run:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local
```

3. Then re-run the slash command: `/gsd.update`

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Check for GSD updates, install if available, and display what changed.

Routes to the update workflow which handles:
- Version detection (local vs global installation)
- npm version checking
- Changelog fetching and display
- User confirmation with clean install warning
- Update execution and cache clearing
- Restart reminder
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/update.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the update workflow** from `@../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/update.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Installed version detection (local/global)
2. Latest version checking via npm
3. Version comparison
4. Changelog fetching and extraction
5. Clean install warning display
6. User confirmation
7. Update execution
8. Cache clearing
</process>
