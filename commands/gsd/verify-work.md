<objective>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.

Purpose: Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, record them in UAT.md and route user to /gsd:plan-phase --gaps in a fresh context.

Output: {phase}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: structured gaps ready for /gsd:plan-phase --gaps
