# GSD Command Reference

**GSD** (Get Shit Done) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. `/gsd-new-project` - Initialize project (includes research, requirements, roadmap)
2. `/gsd-plan-phase 1` - Create detailed plan for first phase
3. `/gsd-execute-phase 1` - Execute the phase

## Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

## Core Workflow

```
/gsd-new-project → /gsd-plan-phase → /gsd-execute-phase → repeat
```

### Project Initialization

**`/gsd-new-project`**
Initialize new project through unified flow.

One command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning:
- Deep questioning to understand what you're building
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with v1/v2/out-of-scope scoping
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown and success criteria

Creates all `.planning/` artifacts:
- `PROJECT.md` — vision and requirements
- `config.json` — workflow mode (interactive/yolo)
- `research/` — domain research (if selected)
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements with REQ-IDs
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases mapped to requirements
- `STATE.md` — project memory

Usage: `/gsd-new-project`

**`/gsd-map-codebase [--fast] [--focus <area>] [--query <term>]`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- `--fast` — rapid lightweight assessment (replaces the former `gsd-scan`)
- `--focus <area>` — scope the map to a specific area
- `--query <term>` — query the codebase intelligence index in `.planning/intel/` (replaces the former `gsd-intel`)

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `/gsd-new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `/gsd-map-codebase`

### Phase Planning

**`/gsd-discuss-phase <number> [--chain | --analyze | --power | --assumptions] [--batch[=N]]`**
Help articulate your vision for a phase before planning.

- `--chain` — chained-prompt discuss flow
- `--analyze` — deep assumption analysis pass
- `--power` — power-user mode with extended question set
- `--assumptions` — surface Claude's implementation assumptions about the phase without an interactive session

- Captures how you imagine this phase working
- Creates CONTEXT.md with your vision, essentials, and boundaries
- Use when you have ideas about how something should look/feel
- Optional `--batch` asks 2-5 related questions at a time instead of one-by-one

Usage: `/gsd-discuss-phase 2`
Usage: `/gsd-discuss-phase 2 --batch`
Usage: `/gsd-discuss-phase 2 --batch=3`

**`/gsd-mvp-phase <number> [--force]`**
Plan a phase as a vertical MVP slice — three structured user-story prompts (`As a / I want to / So that`), SPIDR splitting if the story is too large, then delegates to `/gsd-plan-phase` with MVP mode active.

- Mutates the phase's ROADMAP entry: writes `**Mode:** mvp` + replaces `**Goal:**` with the assembled user story
- Validates the story via `gsd-sdk query user-story.validate` (canonical regex `/^As a .+, I want to .+, so that .+\.$/`)
- `--force` overrides the status guard (required if the phase is already `in_progress` or `completed`)
- Pairs with the new-project mode prompt (Vertical MVP vs Horizontal Layers)

Usage: `/gsd-mvp-phase 1`
Usage: `/gsd-mvp-phase 2 --force`

**`/gsd-plan-phase <number> [--research] [--skip-research] [--research-phase <N>] [--view] [--gaps] [--skip-verify] [--tdd] [--mvp]`**
Create detailed execution plan for a specific phase.

- `--skip-research` — bypass the research subagent
- `--research-phase <N>` — research-only mode. Spawns the research agent for phase `<N>`, writes `RESEARCH.md`, then exits before the planner runs. Useful for cross-phase research, doc review before committing to a planning approach, and correction-without-replanning loops. Replaces the deleted `gsd-research-phase` standalone command (#3042).
  - Modifiers: `--research` forces refresh (re-spawn researcher, no prompt). `--view` prints existing `RESEARCH.md` to stdout without spawning. With neither, prompts `update / view / skip` if `RESEARCH.md` already exists.
- `--gaps` — focus only on closing gaps from a prior plan-check
- `--skip-verify` — skip the post-plan verifier loop
- `--tdd` — plan in test-driven order (tests before code)
- `--mvp` — vertical-slice MVP planning mode

- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`
- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks
- Includes verification criteria and success measures
- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)

Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase 1`
Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase --research-phase 2` — research only on phase 2 (prompts if `RESEARCH.md` exists)
Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase --research-phase 2 --view` — print existing `RESEARCH.md`, no spawn
Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase --research-phase 2 --research` — force-refresh, no prompt
Result: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

**PRD Express Path:** Pass `--prd path/to/requirements.md` to skip discuss-phase entirely. Your PRD becomes locked decisions in CONTEXT.md. Useful when you already have clear acceptance criteria.

### Execution

**`/gsd-execute-phase <phase-number> [--wave N] [--gaps-only] [--tdd]`**
Execute all plans in a phase, or run a specific wave.

- `--wave N` — execute only wave N (see *Plans within each wave* below)
- `--gaps-only` — re-run only plans flagged as gaps by a prior verifier
- `--tdd` — enforce test-driven order during execution

- Groups plans by wave (from frontmatter), executes waves sequentially
- Plans within each wave run in parallel via Task tool
- Optional `--wave N` flag executes only Wave `N` and stops unless the phase is now fully complete
- Verifies phase goal after all plans complete
- Updates REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md

Usage: `/gsd-execute-phase 5`
Usage: `/gsd-execute-phase 5 --wave 2`

### Smart Router

**`/gsd-progress --do "<description>"`**
Route freeform text to the right GSD command automatically.

- Analyzes natural language input to find the best matching GSD command
- Acts as a dispatcher — never does the work itself
- Resolves ambiguity by asking you to pick between top matches
- Use when you know what you want but don't know which `/gsd-*` command to run

Usage: `/gsd-progress --do "fix the login button"`
Usage: `/gsd-progress --do "refactor the auth system"`
Usage: `/gsd-progress --do "I want to start a new milestone"`

### Quick Mode

**`/gsd-quick [--full] [--validate] [--discuss] [--research]`**
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees but skip optional agents.

Quick mode uses the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns planner + executor (skips researcher, checker, verifier by default)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md tracking (not ROADMAP.md)

Flags enable additional quality steps:
- `--full` — Complete quality pipeline: discussion + research + plan-checking + verification
- `--validate` — Plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification only
- `--discuss` — Lightweight discussion to surface gray areas before planning
- `--research` — Focused research agent investigates approaches before planning

Granular flags are composable: `--discuss --research --validate` gives the same as `--full`.

Usage: `/gsd-quick`
Usage: `/gsd-quick --full`
Usage: `/gsd-quick --research --validate`
Result: Creates `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/PLAN.md`, `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/NNN-slug-SUMMARY.md`

---

**`/gsd-fast [description]`**
Execute a trivial task inline — no subagents, no planning files, no overhead.

For tasks too small to justify planning: typo fixes, config changes, forgotten commits, simple additions. Runs in the current context, makes the change, commits, and logs to STATE.md.

- No PLAN.md or SUMMARY.md created
- No subagent spawned (runs inline)
- ≤ 3 file edits — redirects to `/gsd-quick` if task is non-trivial
- Atomic commit with conventional message

Usage: `/gsd-fast "fix the typo in README"`
Usage: `/gsd-fast "add .env to gitignore"`

### Roadmap Management

**`/gsd-phase <description>`**

- Useful for discovered work that must happen mid-milestone
- Maintains phase ordering

Usage: `/gsd-phase --insert 7 "Fix critical auth bug"`
Result: Creates Phase 7.1

**`/gsd-phase --remove <number>`**
Remove a future phase and renumber subsequent phases.

- Deletes phase directory and all references
- Renumbers all subsequent phases to close the gap
- Only works on future (unstarted) phases

## Workflow Modes

Set during `/gsd-new-project`:

**Interactive Mode**

- Confirms each major decision
- Pauses at checkpoints for approval
- More guidance throughout

**YOLO Mode**

- Auto-approves most decisions
- Executes plans without confirmation
- Only stops for critical checkpoints

Change anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`

## Planning Configuration

Configure how planning artifacts are managed in `.planning/config.json`:

**`planning.commit_docs`** (default: `true`)
- `true`: Planning artifacts committed to git (standard workflow)
- `false`: Planning artifacts kept local-only, not committed

When `commit_docs: false`:
- Add `.planning/` to your `.gitignore`
- Useful for OSS contributions, client projects, or keeping planning private
- All planning files still work normally, just not tracked in git

**`planning.search_gitignored`** (default: `false`)
- `true`: Add `--no-ignore` to broad ripgrep searches
- Only needed when `.planning/` is gitignored and you want project-wide searches to include it

Example config:
```json
{
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": false,
    "search_gitignored": true
  }
}
```

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**

```
/gsd-new-project        # Unified flow: questioning → research → requirements → roadmap
/clear
/gsd-plan-phase 1       # Create plans for first phase
/clear
/gsd-execute-phase 1    # Execute all plans in phase
```

**Resuming work after a break:**

```
/gsd-progress  # See where you left off and continue
```

**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**

```
/gsd-phase --insert 5 "Critical security fix"
/gsd-plan-phase 5.1
/gsd-execute-phase 5.1
```

**Completing a milestone:**

```
/gsd-complete-milestone 1.0.0
/clear
/gsd-new-milestone  # Start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)
```

**Capturing ideas during work:**

```
/gsd-capture                                  # Capture from conversation context
/gsd-capture Fix modal z-index                # Capture with explicit description
/gsd-capture --note refactor auth system      # Quick friction-free note
/gsd-capture --seed "real-time notifications" # Forward-looking idea with triggers
/gsd-capture --list                           # Review and work on todos
/gsd-capture --list api                       # Filter by area
```

**Debugging an issue:**

```
/gsd-debug "form submission fails silently"  # Start debug session
# ... investigation happens, context fills up ...
/clear
/gsd-debug                                    # Resume from where you left off
```

## Getting Help

- Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for project vision
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context
- Check `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase status
- Run `/gsd-progress` to check where you're up to
