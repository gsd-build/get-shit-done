# Requirements: Declare

**Defined:** 2026-02-16
**Core Value:** Performance is the product of alignment and integrity. Declare makes both structurally enforced and visibly measured.

## v1 Requirements

### Future Declaration

- [ ] **FUTR-01**: User can declare a set of future truths through a guided creation flow
- [ ] **FUTR-02**: System stores declarations in FUTURE.md as structured, human-readable markdown
- [ ] **FUTR-03**: System detects past-derived language in declarations and responds with Socratic questions (not verdicts)
- [ ] **FUTR-04**: System coaches users from goal/requirement language into declarative future language
- [ ] **FUTR-05**: Each declaration is a standalone truth statement ("X is true") not a goal or requirement

### DAG Structure

- [ ] **DAG-01**: System maintains a three-layer graph: declarations (top) → milestones (middle) → actions (bottom)
- [ ] **DAG-02**: Graph edges flow upward representing causation (actions cause milestones, milestones realize declarations)
- [ ] **DAG-03**: System derives milestones backward from declarations ("what must be true for this to be realized?")
- [ ] **DAG-04**: System derives actions backward from milestones ("what must be done for this to be true?")
- [ ] **DAG-05**: Graph is persisted as MILESTONES.md in human-readable markdown tables, git-diffable
- [ ] **DAG-06**: User can trace any action through milestones to its source declaration (why-chain)
- [ ] **DAG-07**: System provides ASCII/text-based visualization of the derivation structure
- [ ] **DAG-08**: System prioritizes actions by causal contribution to declarations (impact ordering, not sequence)

### Execution

- [ ] **EXEC-01**: System executes actions respecting topological order via topological sort
- [ ] **EXEC-02**: Independent branches execute in parallel (wave-based scheduling from graph structure)
- [ ] **EXEC-03**: System creates PLAN.md files for actions, forking GSD's planner patterns
- [ ] **EXEC-04**: Executor verifies upward causation after each action (does this advance its milestone?)

### Integrity

- [ ] **INTG-01**: Commitments are explicitly tracked with state machine (ACTIVE → KEPT/HONORED/BROKEN/RENEGOTIATED)
- [ ] **INTG-02**: When commitment breaks, system activates honor protocol: acknowledge, inform affected nodes, clean up consequences, renegotiate
- [ ] **INTG-03**: Integrity is presented generatively (restoration-focused), never punitively (no scores, no judgment)

### Alignment

- [ ] **ALGN-01**: Shared future document (FUTURE.md) is referenced by all agents as the source of truth
- [ ] **ALGN-02**: System performs occurrence checks — AI periodically asks "does this still occur as what we declared?"
- [ ] **ALGN-03**: System detects drift when actions have no causation path to a declaration
- [ ] **ALGN-04**: Performance is computed as alignment x integrity (qualitative: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **INFR-01**: CLI integration via slash commands (`/declare:*`) for Claude Code
- [ ] **INFR-02**: All artifacts stored in `.planning/` directory as readable markdown
- [ ] **INFR-03**: Git integration with atomic commits for all state changes
- [ ] **INFR-04**: Custom graph engine (~300 lines) with zero runtime dependencies (bundled via esbuild)
- [ ] **INFR-05**: Fork boundary defined (FORK-BOUNDARY.md) before any GSD code changes

## v2 Requirements

### Advanced Ontology

- **ONTL-01**: Clearing conversations — guided process through Vanto's Assess → Clear → Create cycle
- **ONTL-02**: Default future detection — projects current trajectory vs declared future, surfaces the gap
- **ONTL-03**: Integrity cascade warnings — when one commitment breaks, graph traversal shows downstream risk
- **ONTL-04**: Renegotiation protocol — structured flow for restoring integrity after breaks

### Team Mode

- **TEAM-01**: Multiple humans coordinating through shared declared future
- **TEAM-02**: Per-person integrity and alignment tracking
- **TEAM-03**: Enrollment process — others find their concerns addressed in the declared future

### Platform

- **PLAT-01**: Web dashboard with graph visualization
- **PLAT-02**: GSD migration path (import existing `.planning/` structures)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Gantt charts / timeline views | Contradict declarative model — sequence by time, not causation |
| Time estimates / story points | Anchor in past, become constraining commitments |
| Sprint / iteration cycles | Arbitrary time-boxes fragment future-driven work |
| Kanban boards | Reduce work to status transitions, lose causal WHY |
| Jira/Linear/Asana integration | Embody the past-derived model Declare replaces |
| Progress percentages | False precision — 50% actions complete ≠ 50% future realized |
| Notification system | Creates reactivity; tool should be pulled into, not pushing |
| Natural language task creation | Undermines declaration discipline; structure is a feature |
