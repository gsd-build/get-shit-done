# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** tech_debt
**Milestone:** Declare v1.0

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Summary

| Source | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| REQUIREMENTS.md traceability | 29 REQ-IDs mapped to phases | All mapped |
| VERIFICATION.md requirements tables | 25/29 verified | 4 missing (ALGN-01..04) |

**Score: 29/29 requirements satisfied** (4 via summary confirmation only, no VERIFICATION.md)

### Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements. All 29 REQ-IDs in the traceability table are covered by at least one phase's SUMMARY.md frontmatter.

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Requirements |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| 01 Foundation | exists | passed (5/5) | INFR-01..05, DAG-01, DAG-02, DAG-05 |
| 02 Future Declaration | exists | passed (9/9) | FUTR-01..05, DAG-03, DAG-04 |
| 02.1 Artifact Separation | missing | N/A (no mapped reqs) | — |
| 03 Traceability | exists | passed (11/11) | DAG-06, DAG-07, DAG-08 |
| 04 Execution Pipeline | exists | passed (7/7) | EXEC-01..04 |
| 05 Integrity System | exists | passed (18/18) | INTG-01..03 |
| 06 Alignment + Performance | missing | N/A (summaries confirm) | ALGN-01..04 |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status: STRONG**

- 23/24 exports properly connected (95.8%)
- 4/4 E2E flows complete (100%)
- 29/29 requirements have wiring (100%)
- 0 broken flows
- 0 missing critical connections

### E2E Flows Verified

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Setup: Init → Declare → Derive → Status | 5 | Complete |
| Execution: Execute → Waves → Verify → Honor Protocol | 9 | Complete |
| Observability: Status → Health + Integrity + Performance | 3 | Complete |
| Alignment: Drift → Occurrence → Renegotiate → Archive | 4 | Complete |

### Integration Issue

**verification.js orphaned** (Medium severity)
- `src/artifacts/verification.js` exports parseVerificationFile, writeVerificationFile, appendAttempt
- 0 imports across the codebase
- execute.md writes VERIFICATION.md manually instead of using the module
- Functional impact: None (verification flow works via manual writing)
- Code quality impact: Unused code + inconsistent VERIFICATION.md format
- Affected: INTG-02, INTG-03

## Tech Debt Summary

| Phase | Items | Severity |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 02.1 | Missing VERIFICATION.md (no requirements) | Low |
| 05 | verification.js orphaned (0 imports) | Medium |
| 06 | Missing VERIFICATION.md (summaries confirm) | Low |

**Total: 3 items across 3 phases. No blockers.**

## Conclusion

All 29 v1 requirements are satisfied. All 4 E2E user flows work correctly. All 7 phases completed with 17 plans executed. The single integration issue (orphaned verification.js) is a code quality concern, not a functional gap.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with milestone completion. Track verification.js cleanup as v2 tech debt.
