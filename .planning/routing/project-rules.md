# Project Routing Rules

Project-specific routing rules. These override global rules in `~/.claude/routing-rules.md`.

## Rules Table

| Pattern | Model | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------|
| # Add project-specific patterns here | | | |

## Usage

1. Add patterns specific to this project's domain
2. Patterns match against task descriptions (case-insensitive)
3. Higher priority wins when multiple patterns match
4. Project rules take precedence over global rules for same patterns
