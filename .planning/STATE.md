# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Multiple phases execute concurrently without conflicts, cutting total project build time while maintaining the same correctness guarantees as sequential execution.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Scheduler and Isolation Model

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Scheduler and Isolation Model)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-12 -- Completed 01-02 Event and State Infrastructure

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-scheduler-and-isolation-model | 2/2 | 6min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min), 01-02 (3min)
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirement dependencies -- scheduler/isolation first, then execution engine, then failure handling, then dashboard
- [Roadmap]: Git isolation (worktrees) coupled with execution engine (Phase 2) because worker `cwd` is fundamental to parallel execution
- [Roadmap]: Failure handling separated from happy-path execution to keep Phase 2 focused on core parallel mechanics
- [01-02]: StateWriteQueue uses simple promise-chain pattern (no external library) for serializing async mutations
- [01-02]: Per-worker event files named events-phase-{N}.ndjson for file-level isolation
- [Phase 01]: Hand-rolled Kahn's algorithm (~100 lines) instead of dependency-graph npm -- no new dependencies
- [Phase 01]: Missing dependency references warned but treated as satisfied (lenient behavior)
- [Phase 01]: CycleError thrown at constructor time for fast failure with participant info

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude Code process resource footprint (~200-500MB per worker) may require tuning default concurrency cap after empirical measurement in Phase 2
- [Research]: ROADMAP.md `dependsOn` field has informal syntax variants -- DependencyScheduler parser must handle all formats (Phase 1)
