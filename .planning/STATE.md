# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Performance is the product of alignment and integrity. Declare makes both structurally enforced and visibly measured.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Roadmap revised

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase structure derived from 29 requirements across 6 categories
- [Roadmap]: Graph engine + infrastructure in Phase 1; backward derivation as Phase 2 (core innovation)
- [Roadmap]: Integrity and alignment deferred to Phases 5-6 (need working execution first)
- [Revision]: Renamed DAG.md to MILESTONES.md for user clarity; replaced "constellation" with "set of declarations"

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Backward derivation prompting patterns (Phase 2) are novel territory -- no standard patterns exist. May need dedicated research before planning Phase 2.
- [Research]: Occurrence check frequency/trigger patterns (Phase 6) need experimentation to avoid being annoying.
