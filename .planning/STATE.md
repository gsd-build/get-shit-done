# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Multiple phases execute concurrently without conflicts, cutting total project build time while maintaining the same correctness guarantees as sequential execution.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Scheduler and Isolation Model

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Scheduler and Isolation Model)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-11 -- Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirement dependencies -- scheduler/isolation first, then execution engine, then failure handling, then dashboard
- [Roadmap]: Git isolation (worktrees) coupled with execution engine (Phase 2) because worker `cwd` is fundamental to parallel execution
- [Roadmap]: Failure handling separated from happy-path execution to keep Phase 2 focused on core parallel mechanics

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude Code process resource footprint (~200-500MB per worker) may require tuning default concurrency cap after empirical measurement in Phase 2
- [Research]: ROADMAP.md `dependsOn` field has informal syntax variants -- DependencyScheduler parser must handle all formats (Phase 1)
