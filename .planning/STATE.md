# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Performance is the product of alignment and integrity. Declare makes both structurally enforced and visibly measured.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 01-02 (artifact persistence layer)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 12%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2/3 | 6min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min), 01-02 (3min)
- Trend: Consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase structure derived from 29 requirements across 6 categories
- [Roadmap]: Graph engine + infrastructure in Phase 1; backward derivation as Phase 2 (core innovation)
- [Roadmap]: Integrity and alignment deferred to Phases 5-6 (need working execution first)
- [Revision]: Renamed DAG.md to MILESTONES.md for user clarity; replaced "constellation" with "set of declarations"
- [01-01]: Graph engine uses dual adjacency lists (upEdges + downEdges) for bidirectional O(1) lookups
- [01-01]: Kahn's algorithm serves double duty: topological sort and cycle detection
- [01-01]: Validation is explicit (validate() method), not called by addNode/addEdge
- [01-02]: execFileSync over execSync for git operations (proper argument handling with spaces)
- [01-02]: parseMarkdownTable exported as reusable helper from milestones.js
- [01-02]: Permissive parse, strict write pattern for all artifact files

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Backward derivation prompting patterns (Phase 2) are novel territory -- no standard patterns exist. May need dedicated research before planning Phase 2.
- [Research]: Occurrence check frequency/trigger patterns (Phase 6) need experimentation to avoid being annoying.
