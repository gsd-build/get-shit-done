# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Claude learns to make autonomous decisions based on user's reasoning patterns, only stopping for irreversible/external/costly actions
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Auto Mode Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Auto Mode Foundation)
Plan: 03 of 06 (Quota and Token Tracking)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-15 — Completed plan 01-03 (quota and token tracking)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 30%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| 01    | 3     | 12 min | 4 min    |

**Recent Completions:**

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01    | 01   | 4 min    | 3     | 4     |
| 01    | 02   | 4 min    | 3     | 3     |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initial roadmap: 8-phase structure with Auto Mode first, then Knowledge, then Autonomous Execution
- Sequence: Auto Mode (1-2) → Knowledge (3-5) → Autonomous (6-7) → Integration (8)
- Phase sizing: 3-5 plans per phase target to avoid context exhaustion
- Parallel execution: Phases 1-2 can run parallel to Phase 3
- [Phase 01]: Use comma-separated patterns in markdown tables instead of pipe-separated to avoid delimiter conflicts
- [Phase 01]: Routing rules: project rules override global rules for same patterns
- [Phase 01-03]: 80% soft warning threshold (shows once per session, non-blocking)
- [Phase 01-03]: 98% hard threshold triggers auto-wait calculation
- [Phase 01-03]: Auto-wait returns duration info for coordinator to handle (not blocking in CLI)
- [Phase 01-03]: Both session and weekly quotas tracked independently
