<objective>
Verify GSD installation in Cursor IDE works end-to-end.

Purpose: Confirm that the unified installer correctly deploys GSD to Cursor and all commands, agents, and file references work as expected. This is the gate before cleanup.
Output: Verification confirmation from human user

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Deploy GSD to Cursor test environment</name>
  <files>~/.cursor/commands/gsd/, ~/.cursor/agents/, ~/.cursor/get-shit-done/</files>
  <action>
Run the installer to deploy GSD to Cursor globally:

```bash
node bin/install.js --cursor --global
```

This will:
1. Convert all files from Claude format to Cursor format
2. Deploy commands to ~/.cursor/commands/gsd/
3. Deploy agents to ~/.cursor/agents/
4. Deploy workflows, templates, references to ~/.cursor/get-shit-done/

After installation completes, verify file counts:
- `ls ~/.cursor/commands/gsd/ | wc -l` should show 27 files
- `ls ~/.cursor/agents/gsd-*.md | wc -l` should show 11 files
- `ls ~/.cursor/get-shit-done/` should show references, templates, workflows subdirectories
  </action>
  <verify>
Installation command exits with success (exit code 0).
File counts match expected: 27 commands, 11 agents, 3+ subdirectories in get-shit-done.

  <what-built>
GSD deployment to Cursor via unified installer. All 27 commands, 11 agents, and supporting files have been converted and deployed.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>

**1. Verify commands load (VER-01):**
- Open Cursor IDE
- Type `/gsd-` in the chat input
- Confirm autocomplete shows GSD commands (at minimum: help, new-project, plan-phase)
- Run `/gsd-help` and verify help text displays

**2. Verify agents accessible (VER-02):**
- In Cursor chat, type `@` then start typing `gsd-planner`
- Confirm the file reference `~/.cursor/agents/gsd-planner.md` is accessible
- Alternatively, type `@~/.cursor/agents/` and verify agent files are listed

**3. Verify file references resolve (VER-04):**
- Run `/gsd-new-project` with a test project name
- Verify it can read template files from `@~/.cursor/get-shit-done/templates/`
- Check that path references in command output show `~/.cursor/` (not `~/.claude/`)

**4. Verify VER-03 is correctly skipped:**
- Confirm no hooks were deployed to ~/.cursor/hooks/ (directory should not exist or be empty)
- This is expected behavior - Cursor has no hook support

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] /gsd-help displays help text
- [ ] Command palette shows GSD commands
- [ ] Agent file references resolve
- [ ] Template paths use ~/.cursor/
- [ ] No hooks deployed (correct behavior)

  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "verified" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found.
If issues found, provide:
1. Which verification failed
2. Error message or unexpected behavior
3. Any relevant file paths or screenshots
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Installation completes without errors
2. File counts match expected (27 commands, 11 agents)
3. Human confirms commands load in Cursor IDE
4. Human confirms agent references resolve
5. Human confirms path references use ~/.cursor/
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Automated: Installation exits successfully, correct file counts
- Human-verified: /gsd-help works, commands visible in palette, agents accessible via @
- VER-03 (hooks): Correctly skipped (no hooks directory for Cursor)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-verification-cleanup/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
