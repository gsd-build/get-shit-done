# Skill: Deviation Rules

This skill defines how to handle discoveries during plan execution.

<deviation_rules>
**While executing tasks, you WILL discover work not in the plan.** This is normal.

Apply these rules automatically. Track all deviations for Summary documentation.

---

**RULE 1: Auto-fix bugs**

**Trigger:** Code doesn't work as intended (broken behavior, incorrect output, errors)

**Action:** Fix immediately, track for Summary

**Examples:**

- Wrong SQL query returning incorrect data
- Logic errors (inverted condition, off-by-one, infinite loop)
- Type errors, null pointer exceptions, undefined references
- Broken validation (accepts invalid input, rejects valid input)
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure auth)
- Race conditions, deadlocks
- Memory leaks, resource leaks

**Process:**

1. Fix the bug inline
2. Add/update tests to prevent regression
3. Verify fix works
4. Continue task
5. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 1 - Bug] [description]`

**No user permission needed.** Bugs must be fixed for correct operation.

---

**RULE 2: Auto-add missing critical functionality**

**Trigger:** Code is missing essential features for correctness, security, or basic operation

**Action:** Add immediately, track for Summary

**Examples:**

- Missing error handling (no try/catch, unhandled promise rejections)
- No input validation (accepts malicious data, type coercion issues)
- Missing null/undefined checks (crashes on edge cases)
- No authentication on protected routes
- Missing authorization checks (users can access others' data)
- No CSRF protection, missing CORS configuration
- No rate limiting on public APIs
- Missing required database indexes (causes timeouts)
- No logging for errors (can't debug production)

**Process:**

1. Add the missing functionality inline
2. Add tests for the new functionality
3. Verify it works
4. Continue task
5. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 2 - Missing Critical] [description]`

**Critical = required for correct/secure/performant operation**
**No user permission needed.** These are not "features" - they're requirements for basic correctness.

---

**RULE 3: Auto-fix blocking issues**

**Trigger:** Something prevents you from completing current task

**Action:** Fix immediately to unblock, track for Summary

**Examples:**

- Missing dependency (package not installed, import fails)
- Wrong types blocking compilation
- Broken import paths (file moved, wrong relative path)
- Missing environment variable (app won't start)
- Database connection config error
- Build configuration error (webpack, tsconfig, etc.)
- Missing file referenced in code
- Circular dependency blocking module resolution

**Process:**

1. Fix the blocking issue
2. Verify task can now proceed
3. Continue task
4. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 3 - Blocking] [description]`

**No user permission needed.** Can't complete task without fixing blocker.

---

**RULE 4: Ask about architectural changes**

**Trigger:** Fix/addition requires significant structural modification

**Action:** STOP, present to user, wait for decision

**Examples:**

- Adding new database table (not just column)
- Major schema changes (changing primary key, splitting tables)
- Introducing new service layer or architectural pattern
- Switching libraries/frameworks (React → Vue, REST → GraphQL)
- Changing authentication approach (sessions → JWT)
- Adding new infrastructure (message queue, cache layer, CDN)
- Changing API contracts (breaking changes to endpoints)
- Adding new deployment environment

**Process:**

1. STOP current task
2. Return checkpoint with architectural decision needed
3. Include: what you found, proposed change, why needed, impact, alternatives
4. WAIT for orchestrator to get user decision
5. Fresh agent continues with decision

**User decision required.** These changes affect system design.

---

**RULE PRIORITY (when multiple could apply):**

1. **If Rule 4 applies** → STOP and return checkpoint (architectural decision)
2. **If Rules 1-3 apply** → Fix automatically, track for Summary
3. **If genuinely unsure which rule** → Apply Rule 4 (return checkpoint)

**Edge case guidance:**

- "This validation is missing" → Rule 2 (critical for security)
- "This crashes on null" → Rule 1 (bug)
- "Need to add table" → Rule 4 (architectural)
- "Need to add column" → Rule 1 or 2 (depends: fixing bug or adding critical field)

**When in doubt:** Ask yourself "Does this affect correctness, security, or ability to complete task?"

- YES → Rules 1-3 (fix automatically)
- MAYBE → Rule 4 (return checkpoint for user decision)
