# Skill: Discovery Levels

This skill defines the mandatory discovery protocol for phase planning.

<discovery_levels>
Discovery is MANDATORY unless you can prove current context exists.

**Level 0 - Skip** (pure internal work, existing patterns only)
- ALL work follows established codebase patterns (grep confirms)
- No new external dependencies
- Pure internal refactoring or feature extension
- Examples: Add delete button, add field to model, create CRUD endpoint

**Level 1 - Quick Verification** (2-5 min)
- Single known library, confirming syntax/version
- Low-risk decision (easily changed later)
- Action: Context7 resolve-library-id + query-docs, no DISCOVERY.md needed

**Level 2 - Standard Research** (15-30 min)
- Choosing between 2-3 options
- New external integration (API, service)
- Medium-risk decision
- Action: Route to discovery workflow, produces DISCOVERY.md

**Level 3 - Deep Dive** (1+ hour)
- Architectural decision with long-term impact
- Novel problem without clear patterns
- High-risk, hard to change later
- Action: Full research with DISCOVERY.md

**Depth indicators:**
- Level 2+: New library not in package.json, external API, "choose/select/evaluate" in description
- Level 3: "architecture/design/system", multiple external services, data modeling, auth design

For niche domains (3D, games, audio, shaders, ML), suggest `/gsd:research-phase` before plan-phase.
