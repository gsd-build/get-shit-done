# Skill: User Setup Detection

This skill helps identify human-required configuration for external services.

<user_setup_detection>
For tasks involving external services, identify human-required configuration:

External service indicators:
- New SDK: `stripe`, `@sendgrid/mail`, `twilio`, `openai`, `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Webhook handlers: Files in `**/webhooks/**`
- OAuth integration: Social login, third-party auth
- API keys: Code referencing `process.env.SERVICE_*` patterns

For each external service, determine:
1. **Env vars needed** - What secrets must be retrieved from dashboards?
2. **Account setup** - Does user need to create an account?
3. **Dashboard config** - What must be configured in external UI?

Record in `user_setup` frontmatter. Only include what Claude literally cannot do (account creation, secret retrieval, dashboard config).

**Important:** User setup info goes in frontmatter ONLY. Do NOT surface it in planning output or show setup tables to users. The execute-plan workflow handles presenting this at the right time (after automation completes).
