**Solves context rot — the quality degradation that happens as Claude fills its context window.**

## What is it?

Works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc
```

## TL;DR

1. Install: `npx get-shit-done-cc`
2. In your runtime: `/gsd:new-project`
3. Build in phases: `/gsd:discuss-phase` → `/gsd:plan-phase` → `/gsd:execute-phase` → `/gsd:verify-work`

_"If you know clearly what you want, this WILL build it for you. No bs."_

_"I've done SpecKit, OpenSpec and Taskmaster — this has produced the best results for me."_

_"By far the most powerful addition to my Claude Code. Nothing over-engineered. Literally just gets shit done."_

**Trusted by engineers at Amazon, Google, Shopify, and Webflow.**

## Why I Built This

I'm a solo developer. I don't write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you're building. I'm not a 50-person software company. I don't want to play enterprise theater. I'm just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That's what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

— **TÂCHES**

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It's the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they're running a 50-person engineering org.
